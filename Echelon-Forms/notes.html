In the next chapter, we'll look at <i>Gaussian elimination</i> an algorithm
which can be used to solve systems of linear equations.  This is
arguably the most important topic for the first part of the course.
</p>

<p>
That said, I think the best way to understand Gaussian elimination is
from the punchline: Gaussian elimination converts any matrix into a
<b>unique row-equivalent matrix in row-reduced echelon form</b> (RREF).
RREF matrices are interesting because it's very easy to "read off"
their solutions, no matter whether there are none, one, or infinitely
many (and since the matrix is row-equivalent, these solutions are
exactly the solutions to the original system).  In other words, RREF
matrices constitute the "final matrices" that "represent solutions"
that were hinted at in the previous chapter.
</p>


<p>
So before discussing how to solve systems of linear equations in
general, we'll take one more scheduled detour to look at "solving"
this particularly simple class of linear systems, i.e., those with
RREF augmented matrices.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>

<h2 id="org7e885ee">Recap: Linear Systems with Unique Solutions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7e885ee">
<p>
We've already seen what the "final matrix" look like when we're trying
to solve a linear system in \(n\) variables with unique solution. It's an \(n \times (n + 1)\) matrix of the form:
</p>

\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & b_1 \\
0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & b_2 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \dots & 1 & b_n
\end{bmatrix}

<p>
which represents the linear system
</p>

\begin{align*}
x_1 &= b_1 \\
x_2 &= b_2 \\
&\vdots \\
x_n &= b_n
\end{align*}

<p>
which has a unique solution \((b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n)\).  In other words,
it is a system whose <i>coefficient</i> matrix has \(1\) entries along the
diagonal and \(0\) entries everywhere else.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
The point is that its very easy to "read off" what the solution is in
this system, so if we can reduce a matrix to this form, then we can
read off its unique solution easily.
</p>

<p>
But not all matrices can be reduced to a form like this.  First off,
the shape might not be right: if the augmented matrix of a system is
\(2 \times 7\), we can't somehow end up with a \(2 \times 3\) or a \(6
\times 7\) matrix by row reductions.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> Secondly, not all matrices have unique
solutions.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>  This
leaves us with the following questions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can we characterize the matrices for which it's easy to "read off"
their solutions?</li>
<li>What do these matrices look like if there are no solutions?</li>
<li>If there are infinitely many solutions, how do we characterize <i>all
possible</i> solutions?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="org5665a34">Echelon Form</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5665a34">
<p>
We'll actually introduce two kinds of matrices, echelon form matrices
and row-reduced echelon form (RREF) matrices.  RREF matrices are also
in echelon form, but they have additional properties.
</p>

<p>
First we have to set up some machinery.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Definition.</b> The <b>leading entry</b> of a row in a matrix its first nonzero entry.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> The leading entries of each row in the following matrix are
underlined.  The third row does not have a leading entry.
</p>

\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \underline{1} & -1 & 2 \\
\underline{1} & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \underline{4} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Definition.</b> A matrix is in <b>echelon form</b> if
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>no all-zero rows appear above a row with a leading entry</li>
<li>if a row has a leading entry and it is not the first row, then it
appears to the right of the leading entry in the row above it</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> The matrix from the previous example is not in echelon
form.  It has a all-zeros row which appears above a row with a leading
entry, and the leading entry of the second row appears to the left of
the leading entry in the first.  But it is equivalent to a matrix in
echelon form.  Applying the transformations \(R_1 \leftrightarrow R_2\)
and \(R_3 \leftrightarrow R_4\) gives us the matrix
</p>

\begin{bmatrix}
\underline{1} & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & \underline{1} & -1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & \underline{4} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}

<p>
which satisfies the property that the leading entries create a kind of
"cascading triangular" shape, with the all-zero rows at the end.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Echelon forms are not unique
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Definition.</b> The position of a leading entry in an echelon form of a
matrix is called a <b>pivot position</b>.  A column with a pivot position
is called a <b>pivot column</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that we're interested in also in pivot positions of the
<i>original</i> matrix, not just a matrix in echelon form.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Theorem.</b> A system of linear equations is inconsistent if and only if
its last column is a pivot column.
</p>
