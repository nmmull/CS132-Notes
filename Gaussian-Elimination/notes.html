I'd like to preface what follows with a couple personal opinions about
learning this material.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The details of Gaussian elimination are complex and may file foreign
at first.  What's more important is not that you understand all the
details, but rather that you could emulate the process.</li>
<li>We will use Gaussian elimination in some form for pretty much the
entire course. It might as well be the only tool we use, though we
will interpret the results differently, or apply it to different
kinds of matrices.  Point is: take the time to learn this and
practice this early on.  It will make the remainder of the course
much more comfortable.</li>
</ul>

We've been a bit loose regarding what it means to solving a system of
linear equations.  In the last chapter we learned that, to solve a
linear system we can row reduce the augmented matrix of a linear
system until we get to a "final" matrix which "represents a solution".
Our first goal is to formally define what this "final" matrix is.
</p>

<p>
We've already seen what this final form is in the case that our system
(in \(n\) variables) has a unique solution. It'll look something like
the \(n \times (n + 1)\) matrix
</p>

\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & b_1 \\
0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & b_2 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \dots & 1 & b_n
\end{bmatrix}

<p>
which represents the linear system
</p>

\begin{align*}
x_1 &= b_1 \\
x_2 &= b_2 \\
&\vdots \\
x_n &= b_n
\end{align*}

<p>
which has a unique solution \((b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n)\).  The point is
that its very easy to "read off" what the solution is in this system,
so if we can reduce a matrix to this form, then we can read off its
unique solution easily.
</p>

<p>
But not all matrices can be reduced to a form like this.  First of the
shape might not be right: if start off with a \(2 \times 7\) matrix, we
can't end up with a \(2 \times 3\) or a \(6 \times 7\) matrix (it may be
obvious, but it's worth noting explicitly that the row operations
<i>never</i> change the shape of the matrix).
</p>

<p>
Secondly, not all matrices have unique solutions.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>  This leaves us with the
following questions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can we characterize the matrices for which it's easy to "read off"
their solutions?</li>
<li>What do these matrices look like if there are no solutions?</li>
<li>If there are infinitely many solutions, how does I characterize <i>all
possible</i> solutions?</li>
</ul>
