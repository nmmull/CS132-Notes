Linear algebra is, at its core, the study of <i>linear equations</i>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<a id="org40ff642"></a>
<b>Definition.</b> A <b>linear equation</b> in the variables \(x_1, x_2, \dots,
x_n\) is an equation that can expressed in the form
</p>

<p>
\[
a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \dots + a_n x_n = b
\]
</p>

<p>
where \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) and \(b\) are real numbers.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The numbers \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) in the definition above are called
<b>coefficients</b>.  Variables are also sometimes called <b>unknowns</b>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> The equation
</p>

<p>
\[
  1.2x + \sqrt{3}y + 10z = \pi
\]
</p>

<p>
is a linear equation<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
whereas
</p>

<p>
\[
xy + 3z = 0
\]
</p>

<p>
is not.  Also keep in mind that
</p>

<p>
\[
3(x - 4) = z
\]
</p>

<p>
is a linear equation because it can be expressed as
</p>

<p>
\[
3x + (-1)z = 12
\]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In your first course on algebra, you should have been introduced to
the equation for a line in the plane, a very simple form of linear
equation.  You likely first learned the <i>slope-intercept form</i>
</p>

<p>
\[
y = mx + b
\]
</p>

<p>
where \(m\) and \(b\) are real numbers.  You hopefully also learned the
<i>general form</i>
</p>

<p>
\[
ax + by = c
\]
</p>

<p>
where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are real numbers and \(x\) and \(y\) are
variables.
</p>

<p>
<b>An equation for a line in the plane is the same as a linear equation
in two variables.</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> The equation \(2x + 3y = -6\) is the general form
of the line
</p>

<p>
\[
  y = \left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)x - 2
\]
</p>

<p>
in slope-intercept form.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A line in the plane defines a set of points in the plane (\(\mathbb
R^2\)).  If we plot this set of points, we get (surprise&#x2026;) a
line.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> This is the graph of the line \(y =
\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)x - 2\).  The line is made up of all points
\((a, b)\) such that \(2a + 3b = -6\), e.g., the points \((-9, 4)\), \((6,
-6)\), and \((12, -10)\).
</p>
<script src="example-line.js"></script>
<div id="example-line"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.ExampleLine.init({
  node: document.getElementById('example-line')
  });
</script>
</blockquote>

<p>
Analogously, a linear equation in \(n\) variables defines a set of
points in \(\mathbb R^n\).  We can think of a point in \(\mathbb R^n\) as
something like a tuple in Python, e.g., \((3.3, 12.03, \sqrt{3}, 4)\) is
a point in \(\mathbb R^4\).
</p>

<p>
In set notation, a linear equation expressible as
</p>

<p>
\[
a_1x_1 + \dots + a_n x_n = b
\]
</p>

<p>
defines the set of points
</p>

<p>
\[
\{ (c_1, \dots, c_n) : a_1 c_1 + \dots + a_n c_n = b \}
\]
</p>

<p>
which is a subset of \(\mathbb R^n\).  This notation expresses the basic
fact that a linear equation defines the set of points that satisfy it.
</p>


<p>
If we plot the set of points defined  by a linear equation in <i>three</i>
variables, we get a plane in \(\mathbb R^3\).  We can imagine this is an
infinite sheet of paper floating in space.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> This is the graph of the plane defined by the equation \(x +
y + z = 1\).  The plane includes, for example, the points \((4, 3,
-6)\), \((-3, -5, 9)\), and \((-8, 8, 1)\).
</p>
<script src="example-plane.js"></script>
<div id="example-plane"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.ExamplePlane.init({
  node: document.getElementById('example-plane')
  });
</script>
</blockquote>

<p>
We call the set of points defined by a linear equation in more than
three variables a <a id="org8dc7b75"></a> <b>hyperplane</b>.  We, of course, cannot
visualize hyperplanes, but we can often take advantage of our
intuitions about lines in the plane (\(\mathbb R^2\)) or planes in
Euclidean space (\(\mathbb R^3\)).<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
But as helpful as our geometric intuitions may be, linear equations
are perhaps more useful when we think about them <i>algebraically</i>.
They describe relations that come up consistently in a number of
application domains (e.g., combinatorial optimization, machine
learning, scientific computing).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> Suppose you have \(5\) dollars and you're at a candy store
which sells candies by the pound.  You're interested in buying the
following four candies in unknown amounts.
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">swedish fish</td>
<td class="org-left">$10.50/lb</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">chocolate covered peanuts</td>
<td class="org-left">$7.25/lb</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">peach rings</td>
<td class="org-left">$14.65/lb</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">gummy bears</td>
<td class="org-left">$6.00/lb</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
If you want to spend all \(5\) dollars, then the amounts of each candy
you can buy are related by the following linear equation in the
variables \(s\), \(c\), \(p\), and \(g\).
</p>

<p>
\[
10.50s + 7.25c + 14.65p + 6g = 5
\]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I will leave it to you to map this example onto a more "useful"
domain.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Find two distinct points in the point set defined by the
equation in the candy store example.  What do these two points
represent intuitively?
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Find a point at which the plane of the equation in the
 candy store example intersects the \(s\) axis.  What does this point
 represent intuitively?

The situation is made more interesting by considering multiple linear
equations <i>simultaneously</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a id="org1efd534"></a>
<b>Definition.</b> A <b>system of linear equations (linear system)</b> in the
 variables \(x_1, \dots, x_n\) is a collection of linear equations in
 the same variables.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When we consider a system of linear equations, we're usually
interested in the points which lie in the sets defined by <i>every</i> equation in
the system.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Definition.</b> A <b>solution</b> to a system of linear equations in \(n\)
 variables is a point in \(\mathbb R^n\) which satisfies <i>every</i>
 equation in the system.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> The point \((5, 3)\) is a solution to the system
</p>

\begin{align*}
-x + y &= -2 \\
-2x + y &= -7
\end{align*}

<p>
because if we set \(x = 5\) and \(y = 3\) in each equation, then every
equation is satisfied:
</p>

\begin{align*}
-5 + 3 &= -2 \\
-2(5) + 3 = -10 + 3 &= -7
\end{align*}
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> The point \((4, -2, 0)\) is a solution to the system
</p>

\begin{align*}
2x + 3y + 4z &= 2 \\
x + y + 3z &= 2 \\
x + 3y + 2z &= -2
\end{align*}

<p>
because if we set \(x = 4\) and \(y = -2\) and \(z = 0\) in each equation,
then every equation is satisfied:
</p>

\begin{align*}
2(4) + 3(-2) + 2(0) = 8 + (-6) &= 2 \\
4 + (-2) + 3(0) &= 2 \\
4 + 3(-2) + 2(0) = 4 + (-6) &= -2
\end{align*}
</blockquote>

<p>
We call the set of all solutions to a linear system its <b>solution set</b>
<a id="org35ab75b"></a> (naturally).  Geometrically, the solution set of a
linear system corresponds to the <i>intersection</i> of the point sets of
each linear equation in the system.  So the problem of solving a
system of linear equations is analogous to the line-intersection
problem in the plane.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> \((5, 3)\) is the point at which the lines defined by \(-x + y =
-2\) and \(-2x + y = -7\) intersect.
</p>
<script src="line-intersection.js"></script>
<div id="line-intersection"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.LineIntersection.init({
  node: document.getElementById('line-intersection')
  });
</script>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> \((4, -2, 0)\) is the point at which the <i>planes</i> defined by
\(2x + 3y + 2z = 2\) and \(x + y + 3z = 2\) and \(x + 3y + 2z = -2\)
intersect.

<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Verify that \((7, 1, 1)\) is a point is the solution set of
</p>
\begin{align*}
x + 2y &= 9 \\
3y + z &= 4 \\
-x + z &= -6
\end{align*}
</blockquote>

<p>
One of our primary concerns moving forward will be: <b>what does the solution
set of a given linear system look like?</b> We will eventually be able to
exactly describe the "shape" of a solution set, but for now we will be
interested in two questions.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>(Existence)</i> Does the system have a solution?</li>
<li><i>(Uniqueness)</i> If it does have a solution, is it the <i>only</i>
solution?</li>
</ul>

<p>
And, as is characteristic in linear algebra, we'll introduce
terminology for restating the same thing in different language.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Terminology.</b> A system of linear equations is called <b>consistent</b>
 <a id="org1531a36"></a> if it has a solution. Otherwise it is called
 <b>inconsistent</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> An inconsistent system in two variables with two equations
represents parallel lines, e.g., the system
</p>

\begin{align*}
2x - 3y &= -5 \\
-4x + 6y &= -14
\end{align*}

<p>
is inconsistent.  The lines defined by these equations, when graphed
in the plane, are parallel.

<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Give an example of a linear system in two variables with
 more than one solution.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> It's also possible to build an inconsistent linear system
in three variables with two equations.  This system would represent
two parallel planes.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b> Give an explicit example of a system of linear equations
 with three variables and two equations representing parallel planes.
 Then give a procedure for defining an inconsistent linear system with
 two equations in <i>any number of variables</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Perhaps more interesting, its possible to define a system
 of linear equations in three variables with three equations such that
 every pair of equations forms a consistent system.  Geometrically,
 this would represent three planes which each intersect with the
 others, but do not all three intersect at a single point.

<div id="plane-intersection-inconsistent"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.PlaneIntersectionInconsistent.init({
  node: document.getElementById('plane-intersection-inconsistent')
  });
</script>

<p>
Give an explicit example of such a system.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One nice thing about systems of linear equations (as opposed to say,
the systems of polynomials) is that, if we're just interested
in the <i>number</i> of solutions, it turns out there are only three
options.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Theorem.</b> A system of linear equations either has zero, one, or
 infinitely many solutions.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>If a linear system is consistent and it does not have a unique then
it must have infinitely many solutions.</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> If two distinct planes in \(\mathbb R^3\) intersect, then the
 must intersect at a <i>line</i>.  Thus, there are infinitely many points at the
 intersection of two such planes.
</p>

<script src="plane-intersection-two.js"></script>
<div id="plane-intersection-two"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.PlaneIntersectionTwo.init({
  node: document.getElementById('plane-intersection-two')
  });
</script>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> <i>(Challenge)</i> Suppose that \((c_1, \dots, c_n)\) and \((d_1,
\dots d_n)\) are distinct solutions to a given linear system.  Show

\[
\left(
\frac{c_1 + d_1}{2},

Solving a system of linear equations means finding a solution<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> or showing that no such solution exists.
</p>

<p>
As we just mentioned, it's possible for a linear system to have no
solutions or infinitely many solutions.  We will deal with these
situations soon, but <b>in these notes, we will only consider solving
systems of linear equations with unique solutions.</b>
</p>

<p>
As a warm-up, let's first consider a system of linear equations in two
variables (with a unique solution).
</p>

<p>
Since a linear equation in two variables defines a line in the plane,
and solutions represent <i>intersections</i>, finding the solution to such
a linear system means determining the point of intersection of two
lines in the plane.
</p>

<p>
Going back again to our first algebra course, you likely learned to
solve the line-intersection problem using the <b>substitution method</b>
which can be roughly characterized in the case of two variables as:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>solve for \(x\) in terms of \(y\) in first equation</li>
<li>substitute \(x\) in the second equation</li>
<li>solve for \(y\)</li>
<li>substitute \(y\) in the first equation</li>
<li>solve for \(x\)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> Consider the following system of linear equations
</p>

\begin{align*}
-x -2y &= 1 \\
x + y &= 2
\end{align*}

<p>
Solving for \(x\) in the first equation gives us
</p>

<p>
\[
x = -2y - 1
\]
</p>

<p>
Substituting the right-hand side for \(x\) in the second equation gives
us
</p>

<p>
\[
(-2y - 1) + y = 2
\]
</p>

<p>
Solving for \(y\) in this new equation gives us \(y = -3\), and
substituting this for \(y\) in first equation gives us
</p>

<p>
\[
-x - 2(-3) = 1
\]
</p>

<p>
Solving for \(x\) finally gives us \(x = 5\), so \((5, -3)\) is a solution.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Find a solution to the system
</p>

\begin{align*}
-x + y &= 2 \\
-3x + 2y &= 2
\end{align*}

<p>
using the substitution method.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The substitution method works perfectly well, but it doesn't scale
well if we want to solve systems with <i>lots</i> of variables.
</p>

<p>
The method (which, again, you were hopefully also taught) that will be
useful now is the <b>elimination method</b>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>eliminate</i> the appearance of \(x\) in the second equation by adding to
the second equation a multiple of the first (this solves for \(y\))</li>
<li><i>substitute</i> the value for \(y\) into the first equation (this solves
for \(x\))</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> Consider again the system
</p>

\begin{align*}
-x -2y &= 1 \\
x + y &= 2
\end{align*}

<p>
We can eliminate the appearance of \(x\) in the second equation by
adding the first equation to the second equation:
</p>

\begin{align*}
-x - 2y &= 1 \\
x + y &= 2 &+ \\
\hline
- y &= 3
\end{align*}

<p>
So \(y = -3\) and we can substitute this value for \(y\) into the first
equation:
</p>

<p>
\[
-x -2(-3) = 1
\]
</p>

<p>
So \(x = 5\) and \((5, -3)\) is a solution.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Find a solution to the system
</p>

\begin{align*}
-x + y &= 2 \\
-3x + 2y &= 2
\end{align*}

<p>
using the elimination method.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The elimination method is the basis of <i>Gaussian elimination</i>, one of
our next topics.  In its simplest form, the elimination method has two
phases: <a id="orgeaf8e5f"></a> a <b>forward elimination</b> phase and a
<a id="orga1d6ea4"></a> <b>back substitution</b> phase.
</p>

<p>
Rather than dwelling on how this works in general (we'll get to that),
let's consider a rough outline for using the elimination method for a
linear system in three variables:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>(Forward elimination)</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>eliminate \(x\) from all but the first equation</li>
<li>eliminate \(y\) from all but the first and second equation</li>
<li>solve for the value of \(z\) in the third equation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>(Back substitution)</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>substitute the value of \(z\) into the first and second equation</li>
<li>solve for \(y\) in the second equation</li>
<li>substitute the value of \(y\) into the first equation</li>
<li>solve for \(x\) in the first equation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> Consider the system of linear equations
</p>

\begin{align*}
x + 2y &= 1 \\
-x - y - z &= -1 \\
2x + 6y - z &= 1
\end{align*}

<p>
We can eliminate the appearance of \(x\) in the second equation by
adding the first equation to the second equation:
</p>

\begin{align*}
x + 2y &= 1 \\
y - z &= 0 \\
2x + 6y - z &= 1
\end{align*}

<p>
We can eliminate the appearance of \(x\) in the third equation by
subtracting 2 times the first equation from the second equation:
</p>

\begin{align*}
x + 2y &= 1 \\
y - z &= 0 \\
 2y - z &= -1
\end{align*}

<p>
We can eliminate the appearance of \(y\) in the third equation by
subtracting 2 times the second equation from the third equation:
</p>

\begin{align*}
x + 2y &= 1 \\
y - z &= 0 \\
z &= -1
\end{align*}

<p>
So \(z = -1\) and we can substitute this value into the first and second
equation:
</p>

\begin{align*}
x + 2y &= 1 \\
y &= -1 \\
z &= -1
\end{align*}

<p>
And \(y = -1\) so we can substitute this into the first equation:
</p>

\begin{align*}
x &= 3 \\
y &= 1 \\
z &= -1
\end{align*}

<p>
So \((3, -1, -1)\) is a solution to the above system of linear equations,
and we can verify this by plugging these values into the original
equations:
</p>

\begin{align*}
3 + 2(-1) = 3 - 2 &= 1 \\
-3 - (-1) - (-1) = -3 + 1 + 1 &= -1 \\
2(3) + 6(-1) - (-1) = 6 - 6 + 1 &= 1
\end{align*}

<p>
The following a graph of the planes in the above system.
</p>

<script src="plane-intersection-2.js"></script>
<div id="plane-intersection-2"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.PlaneIntersection2.init({
  node: document.getElementById('plane-intersection-2')
  });
</script>
</blockquote>

<p>
One important observation to make about this example: when we perform
the elimination method, we're creating a bunch of intermediate systems
of linear equations.  Even the last system in the previous example
</p>

\begin{align*}
x &= 3 \\
y &= 1 \\
z &= -1
\end{align*}

<p>
is a just a very simple system of linear equation.  When
graphed in \(\mathbb R^3\), this system is a collection of
<i>perpendicular</i> planes.

<script src="plane-intersection-3.js"></script>
<div id="plane-intersection-3"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.PlaneIntersection3.init({
  node: document.getElementById('plane-intersection-3')
  });
</script>

<p>
As we will come to see, the key fact is that <b>all these systems of
equations have the same solution set.</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Find a solution to the following system of linear equations.
</p>

\begin{align*}
x + 2y + 4z &= 17 \\
-x - y - z &= -8 \\
-2x -3y - 4z &= -22
\end{align*}
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Suppose that there are three companies which each pay for
 a combination of the cloud computing platforms AWS, Google Cloud
 Platform, and Azure.  For simplicity, also suppose that each
 company is paying <i>the same amount</i> per terabyte of data (on
 something like queries).  You know how much data each company has
 used for each service and you know how much they each spent overall.

<p>
Is it possible to determine how much each services costs per
terabyte?  (<i>Hint.</i> This will be a bit of a hassle to do by
hand. Give it a shot, but also look ahead to the next chapter to see
how to do it with the help of a computer.)
