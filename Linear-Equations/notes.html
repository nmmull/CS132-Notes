Linear algebra is, at its core, the study of <i>linear equations</i>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<a id="orge38fe06"></a>
<b>Definition.</b> A <b>linear equation</b> in the variables \(x_1, x_2, \dots,
x_n\) is an equation that can expressed in the form
</p>

<p>
\[
a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \dots + a_n x_n = b
\]
</p>

<p>
where \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) and \(b\) are real numbers.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The numbers \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) in the definition above are called
<b>coefficients</b>.  Variables are also sometimes called <b>unknowns</b>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> The equation
</p>

<p>
\[
  1.2x + \sqrt{3}y + 10z = \pi
\]
</p>

<p>
is a linear equation<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
whereas
</p>

<p>
\[
xy + 3z = 0
\]
</p>

<p>
is not.  Also keep in mind that
</p>

<p>
\[
3(x - 4) = z
\]
</p>

<p>
is a linear equation because it can be expressed as
</p>

<p>
\[
3x + (-1)z = 12
\]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In your first course on algebra, you should have been introduced to a
simple kind of linear equation: lines in the plane.  You likely first
learned the <i>slope-intercept form</i> of a line
</p>

<p>
\[
y = mx + b
\]
</p>

<p>
where \(m\) and \(b\) are real numbers.  You then also likely learned the
<i>general form</i>
</p>

<p>
\[
ax + by = c
\]
</p>

<p>
where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are real numbers and \(x\) and \(y\) are
variables.
</p>

<p>
<b>An equation for a line in the plane is the same as a linear equation
in two variables.</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> The equation \(2x + 3y = -6\) is the general form
of the line
</p>

<p>
\[
  y = \left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)x - 2
\]
</p>

<p>
in slope-intercept form.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A linear equation in \(n\) variables defines a set of points in
\(\mathbb R^n\).  We write a point in \(\mathbb R^n\) as we would write a
tuple in Python, e.g., \((3.3, 12.03, \sqrt{3}, 4)\) is a point in
\(\mathbb R^4\).  In set notation, a linear equation
</p>

<p>
\[
a_1x_1 + \dots + a_n x_n = b
\]
</p>

<p>
defines the set of points
</p>

<p>
\[
\{ (c_1, \dots, c_n) : a_1 c_1 + \dots + a_n c_n = b \}
\]
</p>

<p>
which is a subset of \(\mathbb R^n\).  This notation expresses the basic
fact that linear equation defines the set of points that satisfy it.
</p>

<p>
If we plot the entire set of points defined by a linear equation in two
variables in the plane (\(\mathbb R^2\)), we get a line.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> This is the graph of the line \(y =
\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)x - 2\).  The line is made up of all points
\((a, b)\) such that \(2a + 3b = -6\), e.g., the points \((-9, 4)\), \((6,
-6)\), and \((12, -10)\).
</p>
<div id="example-line"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.ExampleLine.init({
  node: document.getElementById('example-line')
  });
</script>
</blockquote>

<p>
If we plot the set of points defined  by a linear equation in <i>three</i>
variables, we get a plane in \(\mathbb R^3\).  We can imagine this is an
infinite sheet of paper floating in space.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> This is the graph of the plane defined by the equation \(x +
y + z = 1\).  The plane includes, for example, the points \((4, 3,
-6)\), \((-3, -5, 9)\), and \((-8, 8, 1)\).
</p>
<div id="example-plane"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.ExamplePlane.init({
  node: document.getElementById('example-plane')
  });
</script>
</blockquote>

<p>
We call the set of points described by a linear equation in more than
three variables a <a id="org2b3408b"></a> <b>hyperplane</b>.  We can't visualize hyperplanes, but
we can often take advantage of our intuitions about planes in \(\mathbb
R^3\).<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
As helpful as our geometric intuitions may be, linear equations are
perhaps more useful when we think about them algebraically.  They
naturally describe relations that come up in tons of application
domains.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> Suppose you have \(5\) dollars and you're at a candy store
which sells candies by the pound.  You're interested in buying the
following four candies in unknown amounts.
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">swedish fish</td>
<td class="org-left">$10.50/lb</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">chocolate covered peanuts</td>
<td class="org-left">$7.25/lb</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">peach rings</td>
<td class="org-left">$14.65/lb</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">gummy bears</td>
<td class="org-left">$6.00/lb</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
If you want to spend all \(5\) dollars, then the amounts of each candy
you can buy are related by the following linear equation in the
variables \(s\), \(c\), \(p\), and \(g\).
</p>

<p>
\[
10.50s + 7.25c + 14.65p + 6g = 5
\]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I will leave it to you to map this example onto a more "useful"
domain.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Find two distinct points in the point-set defined by the
equation in the candy store example.  What do these two points
represent intuitively?
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Find the point at which the plane of the equation in the
 candy store example intersects the \(s\) axis.  What does this point
 represent intuitively?

The situation is made more interesting by considering multiple linear
equations <i>simultaneously</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a id="org1afd329"></a>
<b>Definition.</b> A <b>system of linear equations (linear system)</b> in the
 variables \(x_1, \dots, x_n\) is a collection of linear equations in
 the same variables.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When we consider a system of linear equations, we're usually
interested in the points which lie in the sets defined by <i>every</i> equation in
the system.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Definition.</b> A <b>solution</b> to a system of linear equations in \(n\)
 variables is a point in \(\mathbb R^n\) which satisfies <i>every</i>
 equation in the system.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> The point \((5, 3)\) is a solution to the system
</p>

\begin{align*}
-x + y = -2
-2x + y = -7
\end{align*}

<p>
because if we set \(x = 5\) and \(y = 3\) in each equation, then every
equation is satisfied:
</p>

\begin{align*}
-5 + 3 &= -2 \\
-2(5) + 3 = -10 + 3 &= -7
\end{align*}

<p>
The point \((4, -2, 0)\) is a solution to the system
</p>

\begin{align*}
2x + 3y + 4z &= 2 \\
x + y + 3z &= 2 \\
x + 3y + 2z &= -2
\end{align*}

<p>
because if we set \(x = 4\) and \(y = -2\) and \(z = 0\) in each equation,
then every equation is satisfied:
</p>

\begin{align*}
2(4) + 3(-2) + 2(0) = 8 + (-6) &= 2 \\
4 + (-2) + 3(0) &= 2 \\
4 + 3(-2) + 2(0) = 4 + (-6) &= -2
\end{align*}
</blockquote>

<p>
We call the set of all solutions to a linear system its <b>solution set</b>
<a id="org411997a"></a> (naturally).  Geometrically, the solution set of a
linear system corresponds to the <i>intersection</i> of the point-sets of
each linear equation in the system.  So the problem of solving a
system of linear equations is analogous to the line-intersection
problem in the plane.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> The point \((5, 3)\) is where the lines defined by \(-x + y =
-2\) and \(-2x + y = -7\) intersect.
</p>
<div id="line-intersection"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.LineIntersection.init({
  node: document.getElementById('line-intersection')
  });
</script>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> The point \((4, -2, 0)\) is the point at which the <i>planes</i>
defined by \(2x + 3y + 2z = 2\) and \(x + y + 3z = 2\) and \(x + 3y + 2z =
-2\) intersect.
</p>
<div id="plane-intersection"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.PlaneIntersection.init({
  node: document.getElementById('plane-intersection')
  });
</script>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Verify that \((7, 1, 1)\) is a point is the solution set of
</p>
\begin{align*}
x + 2y &= 9 \\
3y + z &= 4 \\
-x + z &= -6
\end{align*}
</blockquote>

<p>
Our high-level question moving forward will be: <b>what does the solution
set of a given linear system look like?</b> We will eventually be able to
exactly describe the "shape" of a solution set, but for now we will be
interested in two questions.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>(Existence)</i> Does the system have a solution?</li>
<li><i>(Uniqueness)</i> If it does have a solution, is it the <i>only</i>
solution?</li>
</ul>

<p>
And, as is characteristic in linear algebra, we will introduce a fair
amount of terminology for saying the same things in different ways
(for better or for worse).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Terminology.</b> A system of linear equations is called <b>consistent</b>
 <a id="orga7e10f7"></a> if it has a solution. Otherwise it is called
 <b>inconsistent</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> An inconsistent system in two variables with two equations
represents parallel lines, e.g., the system
</p>

\begin{align*}
2x - 3y &= -5 \\
-4x + 6y &= -14
\end{align*}

<p>
is inconsistent, the lines defined by these equations, when graphed in
the plane, are parallel.
</p>

<div id="line-parallel"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.LineParallel.init({
  node: document.getElementById('line-parallel')
  });
</script>
<hr />
<p>
It's also possible to build an inconsistent linear system in three
variables with two equations.  This system would represent two
parallel planes.
</p>

<div id="plane-parallel"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.PlaneParallel.init({
  node: document.getElementById('plane-parallel')
  });
</script>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b> Give an explicit example of a system of linear equations
 with three variables and two equations representing parallel planes.
 Then give a procedure for defining an inconsistent linear system with
 two equations in <i>any number of variables</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> Perhaps more interesting, its possible to define a system
 of linear equations in three variables with three equations such that
 every pair of equations forms a consistent system.  Geometrically,
 this would represent three planes which each intersect with the
 others, but do not all three intersect at a single point.
</p>

<div id="plane-intersection-inconsistent"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.PlaneIntersectionInconsistent.init({
  node: document.getElementById('plane-intersection-inconsistent')
  });
</script>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Give an example of a inconsistent system of linear
equations in two variables with three equations in which none of the
lines defined by the equations in the system are parallel.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One nice thing about systems of linear equations (as opposed to say,
the systems of general polynomials) is that, if we're just interested
in the <i>number</i> of solutions, it turns out there are only three
options.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Theorem.</b> A system of linear equations either has zero, one, or
 infinitely many solutions.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So if a system <b>is</b> consistent and it <b>does not</b> have a unique
solution, then it must have infinitely many solutions.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> If two distinct planes in \(\mathbb R^3\) intersect, then the
 must intersect at a <i>line</i>.  This means there are infinitely many
 points at the intersection of two such planes.
</p>

<div id="plane-intersection-two"></div>
<script>
var app = Elm.PlaneIntersectionTwo.init({
  node: document.getElementById('plane-intersection-two')
  });
</script>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> <i>(Challenge)</i> Suppose that \((c_1, \dots, c_n)\) and \((d_1,
\dots d_n)\) are distinct solutions to a given linear system.  Show
that
</p>

<p>
\[
\left(
\frac{c_1 + d_1}{2},
\dots,
\frac{c_n + d_n}{2}
\right)
\]
</p>

<p>
is also a solution.

<p>
Solving a system of linear equations means finding a solution<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> or showing that no such solution exists.
</p>

<p>
As a warm-up, let's first consider a system of linear equations in two
variables.
</p>

<p>
Since linear equations in two variables define lines in
the plane, and solutions represent <i>intersections</i>, finding a solution
to this system means determining the point of intersection two lines
in the plane.
</p>

<p>
It's likely we were taught to solve the line-intersection problem using
the <b>substitution method</b>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>solve for \(x\) in terms of \(y\) in first equation</li>
<li>substitute \(x\) in the second equation</li>
<li>solve for \(y\)</li>
<li>substitute \(y\) in the first equation</li>
<li>solve for \(x\)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> Consider the following system of linear equations
</p>

\begin{align*}
-x -2y &= 1 \\
x + y &= 2
\end{align*}

<p>
Solving for \(x\) in the first equation gives us
</p>

<p>
\[
x = -2y - 1
\]
</p>

<p>
Substituting the right-hand side for \(x\) in the second equation gives
us
</p>

<p>
\[
(-2y - 1) + y = 2
\]
</p>

<p>
Solving for \(y\) in this new equation gives us \(y = -3\), and
substituting this for \(y\) in first equation gives us
</p>

<p>
\[
-x - 2(-3) = 1
\]
</p>

<p>
Solving for \(x\) finally gives us \(x = 5\), so \((5, -3)\) is a solution.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Find a solution to the system
</p>

\begin{align*}
-x + y &= 2 \\
-3x + 2y &= 2
\end{align*}

<p>
using the substitution method.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The substitution method work perfectly well, but it doesn't scale well if we
want to solve systems with more variables.
</p>

<p>
The method (which we hopefully were also taught) that will be useful
for this is the <b>elimination method</b>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>eliminate the appearance of \(x\) in the second equation by adding to
the second equation a multiple of the first (this solves for \(y\))</li>
<li>substitute the value for \(y\) into the first equation (this solves
for \(x\))</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> Consider again the system
</p>

\begin{align*}
-x -2y &= 1 \\
x + y &= 2
\end{align*}

<p>
we can eliminate the appearance of \(x\) in the second equation by
adding the first equation to the second equation:
</p>

\begin{align*}
-x - 2y &= 1 \\
x + y &= 2 &+ \\
\hline
- y &= 3
\end{align*}
<p>
So \(y = 3\) and we can substitute this value for \(y\) into the first equation:
\[
-x -2(-3) = 1
\]
So \(x = 5\) and \((5, 3)\) is a solution.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Exercise.</b> Find a solution to the system
</p>

\begin{align*}
-x + y &= 2 \\
-3x + 2y &= 2
\end{align*}

<p>
using the elimination method.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The elimination method is the basis of <i>Gaussian elimination</i>, our
next topic.  In its simplest form, the elimination method has two
phases: <a id="org97f47ce"></a> <b>forward elimination</b> and <a id="org4f91a98"></a>
<b>back substitution</b>.  Rather than dwelling on how this
works in general (we will get to that), here is an outline for using
the elimination method for a linear system in three variables:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>(Forward elimination)</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>eliminate \(x\) from all but the first equation</li>
<li>eliminate \(y\) from all but the first and second equation</li>
<li>solve for the value of \(z\) in the third equation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>(Back substitution)</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>substitute the value of \(z\) into the first and second equation</li>
<li>solve for \(y\) in the second equation</li>
<li>substitute the value of \(y\) into the first equation</li>
<li>solve for \(x\) in the first equation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Example.</b> Suppose we're interested in &#x2026; (chemistry example)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hopefully this is enough to get you thinking about how to apply this
in the case of four variables.
