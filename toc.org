This is a (draft) set of notes for /CAS CS 132: Geometric Algorithms/
at Boston University.  Admittedly, I was unsure if I wanted to take on
this project (in a sense, I still am).  I'm not convinced there's a
need for another collection of notes on linear algebra.  But it turns
out I can't help myself.  I am of the opinion that any good course
needs to be personal, so these are my personal notes, which follow
my way of thinking about and organizing the material.
